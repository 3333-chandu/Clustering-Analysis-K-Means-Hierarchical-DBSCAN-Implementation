# 🧩 Clustering Analysis: K-Means, Hierarchical & DBSCAN Implementation

## 📖 Overview
This project explores and compares three popular **clustering algorithms** — **K-Means**, **Hierarchical Clustering**, and **DBSCAN** — to uncover hidden patterns in real-world datasets.  
It walks through the complete **unsupervised learning pipeline**, from **data preprocessing** and **EDA** to **model implementation**, **visualization**, and **evaluation**.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To gain hands-on experience with multiple clustering techniques, understand their working mechanisms, and evaluate their performance using internal metrics.

## 📊 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values and outliers  
- Normalize or scale features  
- Prepare the dataset for clustering  

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Analyze feature distributions  
- Identify relationships and patterns  
- Visualize data using scatter plots, pair plots, and heatmaps  

### 3. Clustering Algorithms Implemented
#### 🔹 K-Means Clustering
- Used **Elbow Method** to determine the optimal number of clusters  
- Visualized cluster assignments  

#### 🔹 Hierarchical Clustering
- Tried different **linkage methods** (single, complete, average, ward)  
- Created **dendrograms** to visualize hierarchical relationships  

#### 🔹 DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering)
- Tuned **epsilon (ε)** and **minPts** parameters  
- Identified core, border, and noise points  

### 4. Visualization
- Scatter plots showing cluster separation  
- Color-coded cluster representations  

### 5. Evaluation
- Calculated **Silhouette Score** to evaluate cluster quality  
- Compared results across algorithms
