# Clustering-Analysis-K-Means-Hierarchical-DBSCAN-Implementation
This project explores and compares three popular clustering algorithms — K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN — using real-world data. It demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to clustering implementation, visualization, and evaluation
